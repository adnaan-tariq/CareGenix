- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**: For containerized services.
- **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)**: For multi-container orchestration.
- **Python 3.8+**: For running CLI and agent scripts.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.

---

## 🚀 Local Setup

Follow these steps to run Caregenix locally:

## 🤖 Setting Up GenAI Agents

Caregenix supports modular, autonomous GenAI agents. You can register, generate, and run agents using the built-in CLI.

### 1. Navigate to the CLI Directory

```bash
cd cli/
```

### 2. Register a New User (if you haven't already)

```bash
python cli.py signup -u <your_username>
```

Or use the UI at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

### 3. Log In

```bash
python cli.py login -u <your_username> -p <your_password>
```

This will store your JWT token for agent operations.

### 4. Register a New Agent

```bash
python cli.py register_agent --name <agent_name> --description "<agent_description>"
```

- This registers the agent in the backend and generates a starter Python file in `cli/agents/<agent_name>/<agent_name>.py`.

### 5. Set Up the Agent's Environment

```bash
cd agents/<agent_name>
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If a requirements file is provided
```

Or use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast environment setup:

```bash
uv venv
uv sync
```

### 6. Run the Agent

```bash
python <agent_name>.py
```

Or, to run all agents in parallel:

```bash
cd ../..
python cli.py run_agents
```

---

### Advanced: Register Agent via API

1. Go to [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).
2. Use `/api/agents/register` to register an agent.
3. Use the returned JWT in your agent code.
